# Switzerland should change its law

I thought that the reason that I am involved in a lawsuit should be a proper reason to stay in Switzerland. However, after consulting to a professional lawyer, the answer is no. 

This makes many foreigners in Switzerland to be much more volunerable to any kind of crimes than it should be, because even if you have all the evidences, and everything proves that you are right. There will still be an extremely long process of finishing the legal procdure. However, unfortunately, you cannot legally stay in Switzerland only because of you are simply trying to finish the process of protecting your right. If you hire a lawyer, as the immigration office suggested to me, you will have to face a lot of money to be paid. Their average rate is 300CHF/hour. The immigration office was unaware of the fact that most of countries are not as rich as Switzerland, which means that to most of forigners it will be very costly to hire a Swiss lawyer to finish a long legal procedure.

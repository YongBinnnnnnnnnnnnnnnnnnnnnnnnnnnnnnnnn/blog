# 4me.com: 2024, Stolen account
## 21 Mar, Me

Dear Decanato, Dear IT Support Team,

Hope your works are progressing well. I found evidence of someone else was using my USI email account this morning. A Swisscare worker said that they received an empty email from me at 10:26 of this morning but I can confirm and I am certain that I was not using my email at that time. I hope USI can help me to investigate this problem. Could you please give me some advices on this problem?

Best regards,
Bin Yong

Hi @Bin Yong,



We are investigating your issue. In the meantime, could you please reset the password for your account?



I have attached the guide for your reference.



I remain at your disposal.



Have a great day,
██████████████

Hi,
I have changed the password. However, without knowing the method they used to steal my account/token, merely change the password may not solve the problem.

Hi @Bin Yong,

I've spoken with one of our specialists, and from that email, it cannot be inferred that it was sent from our system. You should verify with SwissCare.

Have a good day,
██████████████

Hi @██████████████,
Thank you for the information.
I am also very into information security things and I have learned a lot about it. I hope you can give me some information so I can do some investigation by myself. I hope you can give me a full-detailed operation/login logs about my account of that day. Could you please tell me what do you have as the log?

Hi @██████████████,


I just noticed that there could be some misunderstanding between us. I did not assume that the attacker was using the USI network. What I do assume is that the attacker may left some operation logs that is visible to Microsoft that can be found from outlook management page. I would be appricated if you can give me such logs.


Best regards,
bin yong

# 4me.com: 2024, Request to modify my login security options
## 10 Apr, Me
Hi,

I have purchased two security keys to protect my acount. To achieve better protection, I want to make following changes to my USI account:
First, I want to disable POP3, IMAP, MAPI, and Exchange ActiveSync in Microsoft 365. Only allow Outlook Web App access.
here is a guide:

Second, I want to disable password login of my USI account to Outlook. Attached is a screenshot FYI.



Best,
Bin

Hi,

In case you misunderstood me. My request is not a suggestion to general profile for all students, it is a request to modify my profile to meet the security needs of the threat that I am facing to. So, please change the settings of my profile instead of considering the future development to all students.

Best,
Bin

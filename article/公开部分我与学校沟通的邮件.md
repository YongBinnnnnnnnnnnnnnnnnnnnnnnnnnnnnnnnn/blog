# 4me.com: Request to modify my login security options
## 10 Apr, Me
Hi,

I have purchased two security keys to protect my acount. To achieve better protection, I want to make following changes to my USI account:
First, I want to disable POP3, IMAP, MAPI, and Exchange ActiveSync in Microsoft 365. Only allow Outlook Web App access.
here is a guide:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/user-and-shared-mailboxes/pop3-imap-owa-activesync-office-365Opens a new window](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/user-and-shared-mailboxes/pop3-imap-owa-activesync-office-365)

Second, I want to disable password login of my USI account to Outlook. Attached is a screenshot FYI.



Best,
Bin

Hi,

In case you misunderstood me. My request is not a suggestion to general profile for all students, it is a request to modify my profile to meet the security needs of the threat that I am facing to. So, please change the settings of my profile instead of considering the future development to all students.

Best,
Bin

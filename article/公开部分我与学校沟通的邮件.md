# Email: 2024, Meeting about reported inappropriate behaviors

Dear Mr. Blumer,

Hope your works are progressing well. I hope to make some corrections about the reports you received and to repeat some facts that I have told during the meeting. 

First, about what happened yesterday. I do looked at that person and it may make him uncomfortable. However, there are reasons. Sometimes, someone starts to use the toilet next to me while I was using one, and they always quickly leave the room when I start to clean myself. Most of the time, they do not flush but they can still leave a clean toilet. Yesterday, it was the person who I looked at. I also want to point out that, when he reported to the security, I never touched his belongings and I did not talk to him.

About the day before yesterday. I want to point out following things.
1. That person was the person who started to use loud volume to watch videos, not me. Other students maybe unable to correctly identify who was playing the video because I was sitting next to him. 
2. That person asked me to leave that table and I refused. After that, he grabed my bag and tried to take it away,  but I stopped him. He was also pushing my things away. I recorded that part and I can share it to you if you want.
3. At that night, a security entered the room and left without saying anything. When he entered the room, that person was playing his video very loudly.
4. I played music with about the same volume after he played his videos very loud. (Other students have already left the room at the time) He asked me to stop the music because he is having a Zoom meeting with a professor. However, it was about 00:00 of the night, and it was a multi person meeting on his phone, I have never heard of USI professors would held a meeting at that time. I stopped the music and asked him to use headphones but he refused.
5. One or even more of the students who reported that event was the friends of the student who reported me earlier. I assume they have the incentive to report me when they find a chance.

About the reports from the security guy and other reports.

They are wrong, I have never deliberately sat right in front of a female student while there are more than 40 empty tables in the room. I also have never shout to a Chinese female student. I also feel strange about such reports because when it happens, if I was the security, I would come to stop me, but they never did.

I hope to have a full list of the inappropriate behavior reports of me, so I can make some corrections to the report. I may also find the person who was at the same classroom to ask them to help me prove that I was innocent. I might also be able to point out where the report is unreasonable.

As for meeting doctors, if they allow me to film and publish the meeting, I may accept it.

Best regards,

Bin Yong

Dear Mr. Blumer,

Thank you for the email. I acknowledge receipt of your warning. I repeat, I have never touched the belongings of others, or rather, I am the one whose belongings were damaged or stolen on campus, and possibly filmed. As for meeting doctors, if they allow me to film and publish the meeting, I may accept it. 

I also want to report to about what happened yesterday, to help you understand the circumstances that I am experiencing. I lost consciousness several times yesterday and when I 'wake up' from one of them, I felt a slight pain in my little finger. I didn't care at first because the pain was mild, and I didn't take it seriously. However, the pain grew stronger and stronger until last night I found my fingers swollen. 
This is how it looks last night

This is how it looks now.

And this is how my finger looks normally.

I've experienced this kind of hurting on campus several times before, and I haven't reported it to you because I did not witness the process, and because it usually heals in a few weeks. Reporting this to you also not expecting help, because the place it happened should be no camera and I myself, due to the loss of consciousness, did not see how it happened. I am trying to give you a better understanding of the situation.

As for why I was saying that I was possibly filmed, this animated gif may explain. I have encountered many people who looked like making phone calls but also acting suspicious. This person kept changing the angle of his head to keep the back camera of the phone towards me.

# Email: 2021, Question about HW6

Dear Professor ████,

 

I agree all of your three points about the problem. I think any information security efforts are about the cost of the attackers. Nothing is safe when an attacker has unlimited resources (which also means unlimited computing power and other stuff) . Providing information about the VM won’t let me 100 percent sure what I will be running is trustable but it could increase the cost of the attacker if there’s any. That is also why I’m saying “feel a little safer”. It is okay if you really don’t want to provide the information. Thanks.




Best regards,

Bin Yong

# 4me.com: 2024, Stolen account
## 21 Mar, Me

Dear Decanato, Dear IT Support Team,

Hope your works are progressing well. I found evidence of someone else was using my USI email account this morning. A Swisscare worker said that they received an empty email from me at 10:26 of this morning but I can confirm and I am certain that I was not using my email at that time. I hope USI can help me to investigate this problem. Could you please give me some advices on this problem?

Best regards,
Bin Yong

Hi @Bin Yong,



We are investigating your issue. In the meantime, could you please reset the password for your account?



I have attached the guide for your reference.



I remain at your disposal.



Have a great day,
██████████████

Hi,
I have changed the password. However, without knowing the method they used to steal my account/token, merely change the password may not solve the problem.

## 26 Mar, ZA
 
Hi @Bin Yong,

I've spoken with one of our specialists, and from that email, it cannot be inferred that it was sent from our system. You should verify with SwissCare.

Have a good day,
██████████████

## 26 Mar, Me
 
Hi @██████████████,
Thank you for the information.
I am also very into information security things and I have learned a lot about it. I hope you can give me some information so I can do some investigation by myself. I hope you can give me a full-detailed operation/login logs about my account of that day. Could you please tell me what do you have as the log?
## 30 Mar, Me
 
Hi @██████████████,


I just noticed that there could be some misunderstanding between us. I did not assume that the attacker was using the USI network. What I do assume is that the attacker may left some operation logs that is visible to Microsoft that can be found from outlook management page. I would be appricated if you can give me such logs.


Best regards,
bin yong

Hi @Bin Yong,



Unfortunately, we cannot provide further information regarding this for security reasons.



I remain available for any further information.

# 4me.com: 2024, Request to modify my login security options
## 10 Apr, Me
Hi,

I have purchased two security keys to protect my acount. To achieve better protection, I want to make following changes to my USI account:
First, I want to disable POP3, IMAP, MAPI, and Exchange ActiveSync in Microsoft 365. Only allow Outlook Web App access.
here is a guide:

Second, I want to disable password login of my USI account to Outlook. Attached is a screenshot FYI.

Hi,

In case you misunderstood me. My request is not a suggestion to general profile for all students, it is a request to modify my profile to meet the security needs of the threat that I am facing to. So, please change the settings of my profile instead of considering the future development to all students.

Best,
Bin

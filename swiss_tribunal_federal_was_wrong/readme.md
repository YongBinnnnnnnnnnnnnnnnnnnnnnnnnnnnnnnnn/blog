# Swiss federal tribunal was wrong
Swiss federal tribunal was wrong and I do not even need to read the Swiss law again to point it out! Their mistakes are so obvious that it makes believe that as a place to make judgements, they do not care about the law at all! They should be the place where to have the persons who know the Swiss laws the best, but they still bravely made a lot of mistakes, and made a lot of procedures illegal, when processing my appeal. It could be that the right of making final decisions made them to be care nothing about being illegal. It could also be that the implied professionality from their titles made them arrogantly believe that nobody would dare to point out their mistakes. 

The sad truth is that they are indeed unchallengeable inside of Switzerland legal system. However, as an old saying goes from China, "公道自在人心", "justice lies in the hearts of men and women", I would like to chellange them on the public place named internet.

# Context

 * My appeal sent to Federal Tribunal: [against_court_response_1 - public.pdf](./against_court_response_1%20-%20public.pdf)
 * Federal Tribunal's final decision: http://relevancy.bger.ch/php/aza/http/index.php?highlight_docid=aza%3A%2F%2F16-10-2024-2C_479-2024&lang=de&type=show_document

# Untitiled

I believe my case will not just become a shame of my university USI / Università della Svizzera italiana, it will also become a shame of Switzerland legal system and a shame of Switzerland education system. 

# Draft

At the first glance, there are two problems.

First, they received two documents without signature 
> Con scritti datati 11 e 14 ottobre 2024, non firmati,

However, I am clearly certain that I signed the document of Oct 14. Thus, there could be a crime involved in this case, because the documents sent from me to the court was altered by unkonwn person illegally.

Second, the Federal court ignored some problems I pointed out about Ticino court's dercision. Especially I referred CPC (a Swiss law) to prove that Tribunale cantonale amministrativo (Administrative Court of Ticino) should ask me when they find my arguments are 'meaningless' but the Federal Court completely ignored my argument and mentioned nothing about it in their final decision.

-----

I was appealing the court's decision and pointed out the problems of their decision. The court itself also said that they can only check whether their decision was correct, not merits and demerits. However, in their conclusion, they rejected my appeal with one of the reason called “you have no chance to win”. So they actually evaluated more than the decision itself. They are contridicting themselves.. 

-----

Two courts both failed to distinguish the difference between two kind of decisions. One is the decision of my grade, which happened after my thesis defense when they tell me the grade. Another is the decision of rejecting my appeal. I carefully selected my words used in my case because I know the difference. However they failed to notice my carefulness and was thinking that I want them to change my grade. I was talking about the grade decsion to my university and I was talking about the rejection of appeal to the court. The right of my university to decide my grade is protected by law, but the rejection of appeal may not. This actually unlikely to happen to legal professionals, I assume they are deliberately confusing the two different rights and the reason could be related to [斗贼笔记](../斗贼笔记/).

Of course, without reading the swiss law again, I can point out some problems, and I am sure that my points will be accepted by most persion. However, I want my points used to against this authority of Swiss law to be precise and could be supported by Swiss law itself. Thus, to finish this article, I will need to read some Swiss law, and it will take some time. Do not take the draft section seriously because they are not formally included in this article.

# Swiss federal tribunal was wrong
Swiss federal tribunal was wrong and I do not even to read the Swiss law again to point it out! Their mistakes are so obvious that it makes believe that as a place to make judgements, they do not care about the law at all! They should be the place where to have the persons who know the Swiss laws the best, but they still bravely made a lot of mistakes, made a lot of procedures illegal, when processing my appeal. It could be that the right of making final decisions made them to care nothing about being illegal. It could also be that the implied professionality from their titles made them arrogantly believe that nobody would dare to point out their mistakes.

# Swiss federal tribunal was wrong
Swiss federal tribunal was wrong and I do not even need to read the Swiss law again to point it out! Their mistakes are so obvious that it makes believe that as a place to make judgements, they do not care about the law at all! They should be the place where to have the persons who know the Swiss laws the best, but they still bravely made a lot of mistakes, and made a lot of procedures illegal, when processing my appeal. It could be that the right of making final decisions made them to be care nothing about being illegal. It could also be that the implied professionality from their titles made them arrogantly believe that nobody would dare to point out their mistakes. 

The sad truth is that they are indeed unchallengeable inside of Switzerland legal system. However, as an old saying goes from China, "公道自在人心", "justice lies in the hearts of men and women", I would like to chellange them on the public place named internet.

# Context

 * My appeal sent to Federal Tribunal: [against_court_response_1 - public.pdf](./against_court_response_1%20-%20public.pdf)
 * Federal Tribunal's final decision: http://relevancy.bger.ch/php/aza/http/index.php?highlight_docid=aza%3A%2F%2F16-10-2024-2C_479-2024&lang=de&type=show_document

# Draft

At the first glance, there are two problems.

First, they received two documents without signature 
> Con scritti datati 11 e 14 ottobre 2024, non firmati,

However, I am clearly certain that I signed the document of Oct 14. Thus, there could be a crime involved in this case, because the documents sent from me to the court was altered by unkonwn person illegally.

Second, the Federal court ignored some problems I pointed out about Ticino court's dercision. Especially I referred CPC (a Swiss law) to prove that Tribunale cantonale amministrativo (Administrative Court of Ticino) should ask me when they find my arguments are 'meaningless' but the Federal Court's decision completely ignored my argument and mentioned nothing about it in their final decision.

Of course, without reading the swiss law again, I can point out some problems, and I am sure that my points will be accepted by most persion. However, I want my points used to against this authority of Swiss law to be precise and could be supported by Swiss law itself. Thus, to finish this article, I will need to read some Swiss law, and it will take some time.
